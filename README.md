# Yet another falling sand simulation!!

![demo](./demo.gif)

## Stuff it can do

Sand falls

Water falls

wood burns

Gravity (jankly coded) affects falling materials.

Sand tries to resist falling when in a pile (clumps together).

Water spreads faster so it feels more natural.


## Stuff it cannot do yet (planned)

Water can't put out fire haha

Stuff like the element enum and it's corresponding maps are defined in like 50 different places for no reason.
Should probably put them in the same file.
